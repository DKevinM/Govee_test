1. Reset or Re-pair the Light
Plug in and power on the Govee light.
Put it into pairing mode:
Usually by holding the power button for 5–10 seconds until the light flashes quickly (the exact method can vary by model).
If your light has no button, turning it off and on several times (3–5 times) often forces pairing mode.

2. Open the Govee Home App
Make sure your phone is connected to the new Wi-Fi network (2.4 GHz is required—Govee lights do not support 5 GHz).
Open the app and tap “+” (Add Device) in the top right.
Select your light model from the list.

3. Connect to the New Network
Follow the in-app prompts:
It will scan for nearby Govee devices in pairing mode.
Choose your device.
Enter your new Wi-Fi name and password.
The app will configure the light and reconnect it to the new network.

4. Verify
Once added, the light should appear in your device list.
Test by turning it on/off or changing colors in the app.

If the light was already bound to your account, you may need to remove it first from the app and then re-add it to the new network.
